# 📊 Investment Dashboard – PostgreSQL & Power BI

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed using an existing PostgreSQL database.  
The main focus is the creation of analytical views to consolidate data, which were then used as the data source for building dashboards in Power BI.

The goal is to demonstrate the integration between a relational database and a Business Intelligence tool, applying best practices in data modeling, aggregation, and visualization.
